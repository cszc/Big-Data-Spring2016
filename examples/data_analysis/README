DATA ANALYSIS EXAMPLES

Contents
--------

These examples include several Python packages that you can
import from the Python interpreter. Each module includes
documentation in the code itself.

We have also included several executable Python scripts that
make use of these modules.

Directories:

bin/  - Executable Python scripts

data/ - Data files

src/
  cs123/
     classification/ - Data classification algorithms
     clustering/     - Data clustering algorithms
     ngram/          - Processing the ngram dataset
     topk/           - top-K/max algorithms
     data/           - Code to access various data formats
     common/         - Code used by all the above


Before you start
----------------

These examples require the following Python libraries:

    numpy
    matplotlib
    tweetstream    
    PIL

All of these can be installed using pip (http://www.pip-installer.org/)

Once you have these libraries, you need to set your PYTHONPATH to
include the "src" directory. On BASH, just run this from the
same directory as this README file:

    export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/src:$PYTHONPATH

Once you've done that, you will be able to import the modules, and
will also be able to run the executable Python scripts.


Executables
-----------

To get a more detailed description of any of these executables, just run them
with the "-h" option

max_multiproc.py  - Finds maximum value in a file using multiple processes
topk_heap.py      - Finds maximum value in a file using a priority queue
topk_lossy.py     - Finds most frequent values in a file using a lossy counter
topk_twitter.py   - Finds most frequent hashtags in the public Twitter stream

kmeans_2d.py      - Runs k-means on a 2-dimensional dataset
kmeans_mnist.py   - Runs k-means on the MNIST dataset

knn_mnist.py      - Run k-nearest-neighbors on the MNIST dataset

mnist_show.py     - Visualize a single MNIST digit
